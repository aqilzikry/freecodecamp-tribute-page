				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Early life: </strong>Princess Victoria Mary ("May") of Teck
						was born on 26 May 1867 at Kensington Palace, London, in the same
						room where Queen Victoria, her first cousin once removed, had been
						born 48 years and 2 days earlier. Queen Victoria came to visit the
						baby, writing that she was "a very fine one, with pretty little
						features and a quantity of hair".
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Duchess of York (1893–1901): </strong>Mary married Prince
						George, Duke of York, in London on 6 July 1893 at the Chapel Royal,
						St James's Palace. The new Duke and Duchess of York lived in York
						Cottage on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, and in apartments in
						St James's Palace. York Cottage was a modest house for royalty, but
						it was a favourite of George, who liked a relatively simple
						life.[20] They had six children: Edward, Albert, Mary, Henry,
						George, and John.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Princess of Wales (1901–1910): </strong>On 9 November 1901,
						nine days after arriving back in Britain and on the King's sixtieth
						birthday, George was created Prince of Wales. The family moved their
						London residence from St James's Palace to Marlborough House. As
						Princess of Wales, Mary accompanied her husband on trips to
						Austria-Hungary and Württemberg in 1904. The following year, she
						gave birth to her last child, John. It was a difficult labour, and
						although she recovered quickly, her newborn son suffered respiratory
						problems.
